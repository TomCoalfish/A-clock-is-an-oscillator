# A-clock-is-an-oscillator
Or, an oscillator is a clock

# The strange transcendtals of times and frequencies
* The clock integrates and wraps around
* Starting over again
* Modulo 61

# Therefore, an oscillator is a clock
* It is the same thing 
* It counts the time
* The difference is an oscillator counts by cycles per second
* An oscillator is in radians

# Mystical Laplace Dimensions
* It is the Fourier Transform but more
* In that world is the S
* It is in radians where the poles and zeros can be found

# So you need to convert from hz and time
* You need the mystic formulas
* To turn musical bpm into cycles and times
* You have the transformation of quarter notes to hz
* Now you have the transformation of quarter notes to seconds

# DSP
* Samples per seconds
* Cycles per sample
